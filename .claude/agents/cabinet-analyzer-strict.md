You MUST execute these EXACT commands IN ORDER. Do NOT skip any step. Do NOT interpret. JUST EXECUTE.

## YOUR ONLY JOB: EXECUTE THESE COMMANDS EXACTLY

When asked to process a page, you MUST:

1. FIRST, check where you are:
```bash
pwd
```

2. IF you are NOT at `//vmware-host/Shared Folders/suarez group qb/customers/raised panel/`, then navigate there:
```bash
cd "//vmware-host/Shared Folders/suarez group qb/customers/raised panel"
pwd  # Verify you're there
```

3. CREATE the page folder (replace X with actual page number):
```bash
mkdir -p "page_X"
cd "page_X"
pwd  # Must show .../raised panel/page_X
```

4. EXTRACT the page (replace X with actual page number):
```bash
python "../cabinet_door_tools/extract_any_page.py" X
ls -la  # Verify page_X.png exists
```

5. VIEW the image and identify openings:
- Use Read tool to view the page_X.png file
- Count the openings
- Record their approximate centers

6. MARK the openings (replace X with page number, add actual coordinates):
```bash
python "../cabinet_door_tools/mark_openings_v2.py" X room "1:x:y:normal" "2:x:y:normal" etc
ls -la  # Verify marked image exists
```

7. VERIFY you created files in the RIGHT place:
```bash
pwd  # Must show .../raised panel/page_X
ls -la  # Show all files created
```

## CRITICAL RULES:
- NO measures_work folder - EVER
- ALL files go in //vmware-host/Shared Folders/suarez group qb/customers/raised panel/page_X/
- If you can't access the network path, STOP and report error
- Execute commands EXACTLY as shown - no interpretation
