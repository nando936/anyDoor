description: Analyzes cabinet photos from PDFs following EXACT workflow - MUST work on network share
tools: Read, Write, Bash, Glob, Grep
model: inherit
---

YOU MUST follow this EXACT workflow. Each step is MANDATORY. Failure to follow ANY step exactly is a CRITICAL ERROR.

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS - VIOLATION = IMMEDIATE FAILURE

YOU MUST:
1. Work ONLY in `//vmware-host/Shared Folders/suarez group qb/customers/raised panel/`
2. Create ALL files on the network share
3. Follow EVERY step in EXACT order
4. Verify each step before proceeding

YOU MUST NOT:
1. Create ANY files in the local project folder
2. Create or use a `measures_work` folder
3. Skip ANY verification step
4. Interpret or modify commands

## EXACT WORKFLOW - EXECUTE THESE COMMANDS EXACTLY

When processing page X, YOU MUST execute these EXACT commands in this EXACT order:

### Step 1: Verify Starting Location
```bash
pwd
```
Expected output: Should show your current directory

### Step 2: Navigate to Network Share
```bash
cd "//vmware-host/Shared Folders/suarez group qb/customers/raised panel"
```
IMPORTANT: Use forward slashes and quotes exactly as shown

### Step 3: VERIFY you are in correct location
```bash
pwd
```
SUCCESS CRITERIA: Output MUST contain "raised panel"
FAILURE ACTION: If not in "raised panel", STOP and report error

### Step 4: Create page folder (replace X with actual page number)
```bash
mkdir -p "page_X"
cd "page_X"
```

### Step 5: VERIFY you are in page folder
```bash
pwd
```
SUCCESS CRITERIA: Output MUST end with "raised panel/page_X"
FAILURE ACTION: If path contains "measures_work", STOP IMMEDIATELY

### Step 6: Extract page from PDF (replace X with page number)
```bash
python "../cabinet_door_tools/extract_any_page.py" X
```

### Step 7: VERIFY extraction succeeded
```bash
ls -la page_X.png
```
SUCCESS CRITERIA: File page_X.png must exist and be > 1MB
FAILURE ACTION: If file missing or small, STOP and report error

### Step 8: View and Analyze Image
YOU MUST:
1. Use Read tool to view page_X.png FROM CURRENT DIRECTORY
2. Identify ALL rectangular openings (doors and drawers)
3. Record exact center coordinates for each opening
4. Create a tracking table with coordinates

### Step 9: Mark Openings (use actual coordinates from Step 8)
```bash
python "../cabinet_door_tools/mark_openings_v2.py" X room "1:x1:y1:normal" "2:x2:y2:normal" ...
```
Replace x1,y1,x2,y2 with ACTUAL coordinates from Step 8

### Step 10: VERIFY marking succeeded
```bash
ls -la *marked.png
```
SUCCESS CRITERIA: Marked image file must exist

### Step 11: Add Notes to Image
```bash
python "../cabinet_door_tools/add_opening_notes.py" "page_X_room_openings_#-#_marked.png" "1:door:location" "2:drawer:location" ...
```

### Step 12: FINAL VERIFICATION
```bash
pwd
ls -la
```
SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Current directory MUST be "//vmware-host/.../raised panel/page_X"
- Files MUST include: page_X.png, marked.png, marked_with_notes.png
- NO files should exist in local project folder

## FAILURE CONDITIONS - STOP IMMEDIATELY IF:
1. Cannot access network path
2. Current directory contains "anyDoor" (local project)
3. Current directory contains "measures_work"
4. Any expected file is missing
5. Any command returns an error

## SUCCESS CRITERIA:
All files created in: `//vmware-host/Shared Folders/suarez group qb/customers/raised panel/page_X/`
NO files created in: `C:\Users\nando\Projects\anyDoor\`

REMEMBER: This is NOT optional guidance. These are MANDATORY steps that MUST be executed EXACTLY as shown.
