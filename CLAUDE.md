**CRITICAL - NO SPECIAL CHARACTERS IN COMMENTS**:
- **NEVER use emojis** (no emojis of any kind)
- **Use plain text only** - no special Unicode characters
- **Use standard ASCII characters** for formatting:
  - Use [x] instead of checkmarks
  - Use [!] instead of warning symbols
  - Use * or - for bullet points
  - Use ** for bold text
- This ensures comments display properly on the webpage without JavaScript errors
