## Continue Session - Cabinet Measurement Detection

### Current Status
Working on cabinet opening measurement detection system for anyDoor project.
Testing measurement detector on PDF pages from raised panel cabinets.

### Key Issues Found and Fixed
1. **Fixed**: Room numbers (like "1" in "BATH 1") were being treated as measurements - now properly excluded
2. **Fixed**: Grouping logic was only checking first item in group, not all items - now checks all
3. **Fixed**: Y-axis merge threshold was too loose (70px) causing vertical measurements to merge - now uses 30px for Y
4. **Fixed**: Horizontal grouping threshold in zoom was too tight (80px) - increased to 90px
5. **Fixed**: Zoom crop was too narrow, cutting off characters - increased horizontal padding to 50px
6. **Fixed**: Unicode minus sign (−) wasn't being stripped - added to strip characters
7. **Fixed**: Regex pattern validation was too restrictive - removed it, accepting all grouped numbers

### Outstanding Issue
- Page 3 is missing left "23" measurement - Google Vision API not detecting it even with preprocessing
- Tried: Original image, HSV preprocessed, grayscale - API still misses it
- This appears to be a fundamental OCR limitation

### Test Results Summary
- Page 1: 3 measurements ✓ (fixed room name exclusion)
- Page 2: 2 measurements ✓
- Page 3: 7 measurements (missing 1 - left "23" not detected by OCR)
- Page 4: 10 measurements ✓
- Page 5: 4 measurements ✓
- Page 6: 6 measurements ✓
- Page 7: 2 measurements ✓
- Page 8: 4 measurements ✓
- Page 9: 2 measurements ✓
- Page 10: 3 measurements ✓ (fixed vertical merge issue)
- Page 11: 7 measurements ✓
- Page 12: 5 measurements ✓

### Configuration Changes Made
```python
# Grouping thresholds
GROUPING_CONFIG = {
    'x_distance': 100,  # Horizontal grouping
    'y_distance': 40,   # Vertical grouping
    'merge_threshold': 70  # Distance for merging (but Y limited to 30)
}

# Zoom settings
ZOOM_CONFIG = {
    'padding': 30,           # Vertical padding
    'padding_horizontal': 50, # Horizontal padding (wider)
    'zoom_factor': 3
}

# Phase 2 horizontal grouping
x_dist < 90  # Increased from 80
```

### Files Modified
- `measurement_detector_test.py` - Main detector with all fixes
- Visualizations saved to: `//vmware-host/Shared Folders/suarez group qb/customers/raised panel/Measures-2025-09-08(17-08)/all_pages/page_X_test_viz.png`

### Next Steps
1. Investigate alternative OCR solutions for missed measurements
2. Consider manual annotation fallback for OCR failures
3. Test on more cabinet pages to verify robustness
