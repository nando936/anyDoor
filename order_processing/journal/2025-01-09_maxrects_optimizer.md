# Journal Entry - Maxrects Algorithm Implementation

**Date**: 2025-01-09
**Topic**: Upgraded panel optimizer to Maxrects algorithm

## What We Tried
- Implemented Maxrects bin packing algorithm to replace shelf packing
- Added configurable rotation support for panels without grain direction
- Integrated new optimizer into main processing pipeline

## Key Problem
The original shelf packing algorithm was achieving only 46-51% efficiency on average, leaving significant waste. It packed panels row by row without utilizing gaps or considering rotation.

## What Worked
- Successfully implemented Maxrects algorithm with free rectangle tracking
- Added rotation logic that respects grain direction (defaults to no rotation)
- Integrated seamlessly into existing pipeline with toggle option
- Improved visual diagrams showing rotated panels in different color
- Maintained backward compatibility with old algorithm

## Implementation Details
1. **Maxrects Algorithm**:
   - Maintains list of maximal free rectangles
   - Uses Best Area Fit heuristic for placement
   - Splits free rectangles when panels placed
   - Prunes redundant rectangles for efficiency

2. **Rotation Control**:
   - Defaults to no rotation (grain matters for most wood)
   - Only MDF panels marked as rotatable
   - Can be overridden with settings flag

3. **Integration**:
   - Added USE_MAXRECTS flag in main processor
   - Can switch between algorithms easily
   - Settings configurable per job

## Current Limitations
- For simple uniform panels, improvement is minimal
- Real benefit shows with varied panel sizes
- Still room for improvement with:
  - Multi-sheet balancing
  - Waste piece tracking and reuse
  - Different sheet size support

## Lesson Learned
Advanced algorithms don't always yield dramatic improvements for simple cases. The real value comes with complex, mixed-size panel sets. Default settings matter - keeping rotation off by default was crucial since most panels have grain direction requirements.

## Time Spent
Approximately 2 hours
