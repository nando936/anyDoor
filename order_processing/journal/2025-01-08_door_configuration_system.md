# Journal Entry - Door Configuration System Architecture

**Date**: 2025-01-08
**Topic**: Major enhancements to order processing and new configuration architecture

## What We Accomplished Today
- Added automatic PDF movement from "need to process" to "processed" folders
- Implemented panel sheet calculations with exact usage (e.g., 1.03sh)
- Added board feet calculations for materials
- Improved cut list formatting with justified dimensions and better spacing
- Created sample order generator system with dedicated folder
- Updated README with all new features and clarified that formulas are door-specific

## Key Problem Solved
The system was using hardcoded formulas which could cause confusion since each door style has unique specifications. We clarified that all formulas come from spec files and are style-specific.

## New Architecture Concept
Designed a modular configuration system with five components:
1. **Construction Methods** - Reusable calculation templates (cope & stick, mitre cut)
2. **Material Schedules** - Material specifications for components
3. **Hardware Schedules** - Hinge patterns and mounting specs
4. **Profile Library** - Edge and panel profile definitions
5. **Door Styles** - Combines all components with style-specific details

## What Worked
- Current system remains stable and functional
- All new features integrated smoothly
- Automatic file movement prevents clutter
- Sample order generator makes testing easier

## Next Steps
1. Create parallel door configuration system (won't affect current code)
2. Build folder structure for all configuration components
3. Create JSON templates for existing door styles (103, 231)
4. Build door_configuration.py module to load and manage configs
5. Test parallel system against current output
6. Gradually migrate once verified identical results

## Lesson Learned
Building a parallel system for testing prevents breaking working code. Modular architecture with separated concerns (construction, materials, hardware, profiles) provides flexibility and reusability while maintaining clarity.

## Time Spent
~3 hours on enhancements and architecture design
