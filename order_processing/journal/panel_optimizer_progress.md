# Journal Entry - Panel Optimizer Implementation

**Date**: 2025-09-08
**Topic**: Complete panel optimizer with 2D bin packing

## What We Built
- Full panel optimization system using FFDH (First Fit Decreasing Height) algorithm
- Extracts panels from door dimensions (door size minus frame width)
- Groups panels by material type for consistent sheet usage
- Generates visual SVG diagrams with panels laid out on sheets
- Creates step-by-step cutting instructions for shop use

## Key Features Implemented
1. **Rotated Display**: Sheet diagrams rotate 90Â° to fill 8.5x11 page width
2. **Bottom-Left Origin**: Uses (0,0) at bottom-left matching shop coordinates  
3. **Readable Text**: Panel numbers and dimensions display horizontally
4. **Proper Scaling**: Fits page with 0.5" margins, panels stay within boundaries
5. **Automatic Integration**: Generates after cut list in processing pipeline

## Problems We Solved
- Fixed coordinate system from top-left to bottom-left origin
- Corrected text rotation so labels read horizontally not vertically
- Fixed panel overflow beyond sheet boundaries (was scaling issue)
- Resolved material separation causing inefficient sheet usage
- Changed panel stroke width for better visual appearance

## Current Algorithm Limitations
- Uses simple shelf packing (row by row)
- Doesn't fill gaps with smaller pieces
- No rotation optimization for better fit
- Groups strictly by material type

## What Works Well
- Successfully packs all panels onto sheets
- Clear visual diagrams for shop use
- Accurate cutting instructions
- Proper page layout for printing
- Calculates efficiency metrics

## Next Steps for Improvement
1. **Better Packing Algorithm**
   - Implement true 2D bin packing (like Maxrects or Guillotine)
   - Try fitting smaller pieces in gaps
   - Consider panel rotation when grain allows

2. **Material Optimization**
   - Option to mix materials on sheets when appropriate
   - User setting for strict vs mixed material separation

3. **Multi-Sheet Strategy**
   - Better distribution across multiple sheets
   - Balance sheet usage instead of filling sequentially

4. **Enhanced Features**
   - Add kerf/blade width to settings
   - Support different sheet sizes (not just 4x8)
   - Export cut list to CNC format
   - Add waste tracking and reuse

5. **Performance Metrics**
   - Track historical efficiency rates
   - Suggest optimal panel sizes for better yield
   - Cost calculation based on material waste

## Lesson Learned
Material consistency is crucial - mixing "Paint Grade" notes with regular materials caused unnecessary sheet separation. The simple shelf algorithm works but leaves significant waste (46% on average). A more sophisticated packing algorithm could improve efficiency to 70-80%.

## Time Spent
Approximately 3 hours - implementation, debugging, and refinements
