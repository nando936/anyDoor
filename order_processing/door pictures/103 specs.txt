stiles and rails are 2 1/4" wide using a 1/2 deep stick depth tool

inside sticking = Quater round
outside profile = none

material is 13/16 thick for stiles and rails

and for the panel it is whatever is called out in the order for the panel

this is a cope and stick  door so stile and rail length calculations are as follows:
the stile is cut 1/4 longer and 1/8 wider for triming
the rail is door finish width - ((2*rail width) + (2*stick depth))

sticking for this style is 1/2 

panel sizes for the door will be 
height = finish sizes - (rail width + ((stick*2) - 1/8))
width = finish size -(rail width + ((stick*2) - 1/8))


this is a 5 piece door
a 5 piece door has 5 parts it has 
2 stiles
2 rails
1 panel
