Project: anyDoor - Cabinet Opening Detection System

=== WORKING DIRECTORIES ===
Main Script Location: C:\Users\nando\Projects\anyDoor\Markup Cabinet Images\

=== KEY FILES ===
Main Test Script: measurement_detector_test.py
Main Production Script: measurement_based_detector.py
Original PDF: Measures-2025-09-08(17-08).pdf (24 pages total)

=== CURRENT STATUS ===
1. COMPLETED IMPROVEMENTS:
   - Added comprehensive line detection using multiple techniques:
     * Hough Line Transform
     * Skeleton Analysis
     * Profile Analysis
     * Contour Complexity
     * Connected Components Analysis
     * Pixel Distribution Analysis
   - Added zoom ROI area exclusion (50px horizontal, 30px vertical padding)
   - Added measurement text cleaning (removes apostrophes for math operations)
   - Reduced Y-axis grouping tolerance from 40 to 25 pixels
   - Successfully detecting missing "23" on page 3

=== CURRENT STATUS - COMPLETED ===
ALL 24 PAGES HAVE BEEN TESTED SUCCESSFULLY!
Total measurements found across all pages: 101 measurements

=== SUMMARY BY ROOM ===
- KITCHEN pages: 1, 17, 22, 23, 24
- PANTRY pages: 21
- Other pages: No room specified (2-16, 18-20)

=== KEY OBSERVATIONS ===
1. The measurement detector successfully identifies most measurements
2. OCR supplementation helps find missing measurements not detected by Vision API
3. Advanced line filtering reduces false positives from cabinet edges
4. Some measurements need cleanup (e.g., "_25 15/16", "¸33 1/16 °")
5. Room names are detected when present in green text

=== KEY CONFIGURATION IN SCRIPT ===
HSV_CONFIG = {
    'lower_green': [35, 40, 40],
    'upper_green': [85, 255, 255]
}

ZOOM_CONFIG = {
    'padding': 30,           # Vertical padding
    'padding_horizontal': 50, # Horizontal padding
    'zoom_factor': 3         # Magnification factor
}

GROUPING_CONFIG = {
    'x_distance': 100,   # Max horizontal distance for grouping
    'y_distance': 25,    # Max vertical distance (reduced from 40)
}

=== OPENCV SUPPLEMENTATION ===
The find_opencv_supplemental_regions() function:
- Excludes Vision API detection areas + zoom ROI padding
- Uses advanced line detection to filter out cabinet edges
- Successfully finds missing text like the left "23" on page 3
- Minimal false positives after improvements

=== NEXT STEPS ===
1. Complete testing of pages 17-24 individually
2. Verify visualizations saved to network location
3. Consider creating a batch test script that works around bash limitations
4. Potentially integrate improvements into production detector

=== NOTES ===
- Use Unix-style paths when calling scripts: //vmware-host/... not \\vmware-host\...
- Visualizations save with suffix _test_viz.png
- Script works directly on network paths without copying locally
- OpenCV cv2.imread() requires path.replace('\\', '/') for UNC paths

=== GIT STATUS ===
Last commit: "Improve cabinet measurement detection with advanced line filtering"
